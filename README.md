- ðŸ‘‹   Hi, Iâ€™m @CTAlcala. I've served in the Army for nearly 18 years and am currently in the process of medical retirement, scheduled to be completed by August 30th, 2024. Since my teenage years, I've been fascinated by electronics and computers. Recently, I've been drawn to learning coding and delving into the world of cybersecurity.
- ðŸŒ± "Hello everyone! Currently, I'm learning Python and Linux, with plans to follow up by studying Splunk to enhance my passion for cybersecurity. Recently, I earned my A+ and NET+ certifications through Western Tech, and I'm on track to obtain my SEC+ by August. Additionally, I'm studying cybersecurity through Coursera, covering courses in Communication, Computer Programming, Leadership and Management, Project Management, Programming Principles, and Python Programming. I'm enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity and connecting with others who share this interest!
